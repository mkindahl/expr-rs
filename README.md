# Recursive decent expression parser implemented in Rust

This will allow parsing a string and evaluating it as an
expression. It is implemented as a library so that it can be embedded
into other applications and only has dependencies on the standard
library to be as lightweight as possible.

It includes a simple binary for evaluating expressions.
